# Experiments

Exploratory experiments testing whether hitting times can be computed from the
complex eigendecomposition of non-symmetrized transition matrices, and whether
they yield a meaningful quasi-metric for exploration in grid environments.

## Experiment 01: Complex Eigendecomposition of Portal Environments

Analyzes eigenspace distances from portal-based (teleportation) grid
environments. Tests if the real and imaginary components of complex
eigenvectors correlate with environment distances.

See [experiments/01/README.md](01/README.md) for details.

## Experiment 02: Eigendecomposition of Irreversible Door Environments

Analyzes asymmetric transition dynamics created by one-way doors (blocked
reverse transitions). Compares hitting time asymmetry with eigenvector
structure in a more physically interpretable setup than portals.

See [experiments/02/README.md](02/README.md) for details.
